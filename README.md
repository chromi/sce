# sce

This is the [SCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-morton-tsvwg-sce/)
(Some Congestion Experienced) reference implementation, containing:

- the new TCP CC algorithms reno-sce, dctcp-sce and cubic-sce
- changes to the Cake qdisc for SCE signaling
- changes to TCP input for SCE to ESCE feedback
- additional qdiscs under testing

## Status

The reno-sce and dctcp-sce CC algorithms are working. cubic-sce is still
undergoing development and testing. We welcome any problem reports as issues
on this repo.

## Compiling the kernel

Compile the Linux kernel as usual, making sure to include the new CC algorithms
in the config (under Networking support > Networking options > TCP: advanced
congestion control) and the Cake qdisc (under Networking support >
Networking options > QoS and/or fair queueing). Here's a quick overview of a
typical way to do this:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses-dev libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/chromi/sce
cd sce
make menuconfig # configure kernel, include all TCP CC algos and Cake
make -j $(nproc)
make modules
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
sudo reboot
```

## Compiling iproute2

New qdiscs and parameters are added which require changes to the tc binary.
Below are the commands that may be used to compile and install the updated tc.

```
sudo apt-get install pkg-config bison flex libcap-dev libmnl-dev libelf-dev libdb-dev
git clone https://github.com/heistp/iproute2-sce
cd iproute2-sce
./configure
make
# use the resulting tc/tc binary when working with SCE qdiscs
```

## Sysctls

By default, SCE is not enabled. The following sysctls may be used to control
the operation of SCE and related functionality:

- `net.ipv4.tcp_sce` - set to 1 to feed back SCE to ESCE (for receivers)
- `net.ipv4.tcp_ecn` - set to 1 to enable ECN during connection initiation
  (for senders)
- `net.ipv4.ip_forward` - set to 1 to enable IP forwarding, e.g. on middleboxes
  running Cake
- `net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control` - set to one of reno-sce, dctcp-sce or
  cubic-sce to default all TCP connections to use this CC algorithm, although
  setting it explicitly for individual test flows may be the preferred method

In some setups, changing Linux's default pacing parameters may improve
performance and reduce CE marks or drops (e.g. the one that may sometimes be
seen as a flow reaches BDP). We've found the following settings to be an
interesting starting point for experimentation:

- `net.ipv4.tcp_pacing_ca_ratio` - set to 40 (Linux default is 120)
- `net.ipv4.tcp_pacing_ss_ratio` - set to 100 (Linux default is 200)

## Cake and its SCE related parameters

To test SCE, a bottleneck and SCE marking are needed between the TCP sender
and receiver. Unless supplied another way, the Cake qdisc from this kernel
must be used at the bottleneck. Cake's shaper is used to restrict bandwidth
and create a bottleneck, then Cake can be configured to do SCE marking, which
will mark IP packets with SCE as queue sojourn times increase. An example
invocation of Cake is as follows:

```
tc qdisc add dev enp1s0 root cake besteffort bandwidth 10Mbit sce
```

Replace enp1s0 with your interface and 10Mbit with your bandwidth. On a
middlebox with two interfaces, you may want Cake applied on both interfaces.
The `sce` parameter tells Cake to do SCE marking. The following additional
parameters may be used to control the operation of SCE:

- `sce-single` - maximally prefers SCE vs non-SCE fairness over early SCE
  signaling.
- `sce-thresh #` - where # is a number from 1-1024, with 1 being equivalent
  to `sce`, and 1024 being nearly equivalent to `sce-single`. This balances SCE
  vs non-SCE throughput fairness with earlier SCE signaling. Numbers around 20
  may yield a reasonable balance for 50Mbit at 80ms for reno vs reno-sce
  competition, for example. This setting is still undergoing testing.

## Testing

A full explanation of the testing options is beyond the scope of this
document, but for starters, one might wish to initiate a simple test of a
single flow using iperf3. Here's an example using reno-sce, and note that
root is required to explicitly set the TCP CC algorithm.

```
sudo iperf3 -C reno-sce -c server
```

The [Flent](https://flent.org) tool, which has the ability to run tests with
different CC algorithms, may be used for single and multi-flow tests along
with latency measurement flows.

A tool called `scetrace` has been implemented that uses libpcap to record
per-flow SCE and related statisics from either pcap files or live captures.
This is available [here](https://github.com/heistp/scetrace).

## Feedback branch

There is a separate branch called `feedback` on which is an implementation of a
different receiver feedback algorithm called "dithered" feedback, which is
still undergoing testing. It trades off less timely ESCE marked ACKs for a
reduction in ACKs on the ACK path back to the TCP standard of 50%, whereas
around 60% is expected with the default algorithm. The sysctl
`net.ipv4.tcp_sce_feedback` controls which algorithm is used, with 1 meaning
the default algorithm (and is the default), and 0 meaning dithered feedback.
